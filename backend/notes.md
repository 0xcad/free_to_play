Make a website with chat, video stream, and payment systems

* embed video as a live stream on youtube, then add our own chat system to website
* no plans to hook game to the website
* one person has moderator controls

* like 50 people audience
* when people send it goes out immediately
* just type in a username and start chatting
    * no duplicate names allowed
* moderator can mute people
* delete messages obviously
* funny: moderator can click on a user's name, and their phone screen (i.e website) just gets locked and flashes red

a system to select a user randomly, from users that haven't been selected
* and nice to have: if a user has been muted or smtg they're not in the raffle


tell them how much the domain costs, too. and hosting.
aestetic doesn't matter for now

## wants
* embed live stream on youtube
* custom chat system
* moderator controls
    * mute people, delete messages
* raffle system
